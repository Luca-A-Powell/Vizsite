        <h3> National Motor Carrier Crashes by Company</h3>

    <div class="copy">
        <p>Motor carrier crashes are heavily concentrated among a small number of large trucking companies, according to the data.
        The companies with the highest crash counts far outpace the rest,
         suggesting that fleet size and miles driven play a major role in overall crash totals.
        </p>

        <p> At the top of the list are national carriers with extensive operations across multiple states.
        Their crash counts are several times higher than smaller competitors, creating a sharp drop-off after the first few companies.
         This pattern highlights how a handful of firms account for a disproportionate share of reported incidents.
        </p>

        <p>Safety experts caution that raw crash totals alone do not tell the full story, noting that larger fleets naturally face more exposure.
        Still, the data raises questions about whether enforcement, training, and oversight keep pace as companies scale up their operations.
