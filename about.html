		<div class="about">
            <p>Hey there, I'm Luca. I'm a reporter at the Richmond Times-Dispatch. My specialty is accountability journalism. Over the years, I've written
                about stolen art in Virginia's museums, polluting plastics plants, state prosecutors burying evidence
                and plenty of state and local government exposes.</p>
            <p>Before working at the Times-Dispatch, I covered Traverse City, Michigan, for the 
                Traverse City Record-Eagle, where my project
                on guardianship abuses in northern Michigan was a finalist for the Scripps Award.</p>   
            </p>
            <p> I'm a proud graduate of the CUNY Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
            <p> This site is also a home for my data viz work. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
