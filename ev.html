    <h1> Electric Vehicle ownership in Virginia</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="explainer">
        <p>Electric vehicle ownership in Virginia is highly concentrated, and the data makes that clear right away. A small number of Northern Virginia counties account for a large share of the EVs on the road.<br><br> Fairfax County alone has more than 28,000 registered electric vehicles in this dataset, far outpacing any other county. Loudoun, Prince William, and Arlington also sit near the top. <br><br> This pattern reflects where population, income, and daily commuting patterns overlap, especially in the Washington, D.C. metro area, where shorter commutes and higher household incomes make EV ownership more practical and appealing. <br><br></p>

        When you look at EVs per 1,000 people, the regional divide becomes even sharper. Loudoun County stands out with an especially high rate, while Fairfax also shows strong adoption relative to population. <br><br> In contrast, many counties across central and southwestern Virginia have EV ownership rates that are an order of magnitude lower. For half of the counties in the dataset, there are fewer than 20 EVs per 1,000 residents. <br><br>This suggests that EV adoption in Virginia is not spreading evenly outward from urban cores, but instead remains clustered in a few high-adoption pockets. <br><br>

        Infrastructure appears to be part of the story as well. ZIP codes with higher EV counts often also show heavier demand per Level 2 charging port, implying that chargers are being used intensely where EV adoption is already strong. Meanwhile, many rural or smaller counties show both low EV counts and sparse charging infrastructure, which can reinforce slow adoption. If charging access remains limited in these areas, it may continue to act as a barrier for potential EV buyers who do not have reliable home charging. <br><br>

        Overall, the data tells a story of uneven growth rather than a statewide surge. Virginia’s EV transition is being led by Northern Virginia suburbs, while much of the rest of the state is still in an early adoption phase. <br><br>If policymakers want EV ownership to grow more evenly, the numbers suggest that investments in charging infrastructure and targeted incentives outside the D.C. metro region will matter just as much as statewide goals. As it stands, EVs in Virginia are becoming common in some places and still rare in many others. <br><br>
